# Data-structures & Algorihtms

This is a collection of various problems for learning of Data Structures & Algorithms that I try to learn from Internet and recollect & modify them here:

The main purpose to store it in github is that it helps practice git commands and secondly motivation to work out new DS to commit in this repo as it is a public repo! It includes various problems on topics that are used in competitive programming, developing problem-solving logic & improvising data structures and many programs that include various different algorithms !

To continue further growth of this repository I'm submitting it for hacktober-fest 2021 anybody who has a knack for programming can send pull requests for improving as well as adding new and better code to the repository.
