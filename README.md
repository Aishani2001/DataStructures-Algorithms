# DataStructures-
This is a collection of personal practice & learning od Data Structures & Algorithms that I try to learn from Internet and recollect & modify them here:
The main purpose to store it in github is that it helps practice git commands and secondly motivation to work out new DS to commit in this repo as it is a public repo!
It includes various problems on topics that are used in competitive programming, developing problem-solving logic & improvising data structures!
